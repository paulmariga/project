Although there are strides that have been made by African Americans in many areas of life, there is still a long way to go. Black people lag in unemployment rates, education, life expectancy and income.   
First in Racial discrimination and stereo-typing. Just recently there has been a spike of calls being made to 911 on people just based on the color of their skin. A good example is a woman who called cops on an 8-year-old black girl who was selling bottled water in San Francisco. Even in immigration to the united states has become blatantly racist. Recently the President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, complained that the US is letting in immigrants from “shit-hole countries in Africa. </p>

<p>Police brutality is another area where African Americans are treated unfairly in comparison to their white counterparts. A scenario that is still mind boggling happened in June 2015, when Dylann Roof, a white supremacist went to Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina and killed nine African American worshippers. There was a car chase that ended into Roof being arrested unharmed- Even though the police knew he was armed and dangerous) to make matters worse he was taken to McDonald’s for lunch. I am sure if Dylann Roof was black, they would have shot him dead. It is a fact several black men have got shot and killed for “being thought to be armed”. </p>
<p>Also, there is high incarceration rates thanks to war on drugs. D.L Hughley in his book How Not to Get Shot writes on the issue of opioids “If you are white and on opioids that is a crisis, but if you are black and on crack that is a crime”.  This depicts on how justice is applied unfairly to black people are treated unfairly by the police. The recent spike of opioid use in white communities led to a commission being formed to investigate the opioid crisis. While crack addicts are being incarcerated. Reason? Crack addicts are predominantly black. Andrew Cohen of The Atlantic writes on the difference between crack and cocaine “Crack was an inner-city drug, a street-corner drug, a drug of gangs and guns that white America largely experienced from a distance. Powder cocaine, The federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act, passed in 1986, imposed mandatory-minimum sentences that were far harsher on users of crack cocaine than on those found with the drug in powdered form. This has led to high rates of African Americans. </p>
<p>Education is another front where African Americans have been left behind.  Schools in the inner cities are understaffed, underfunded and poorly equipped. Ariel Jao of the Associated Press writes:</p>

Residential segregation causes a disparity in educational opportunity because it creates higher-income communities, with predominantly white school districts that have more local tax revenue for their schools, compared to fewer dollars and resources for school districts in low-income, minority neighborhoods.</p>
This in turn has led to low graduation rates in the African Communities which in turn has led to high levels of unemployment due to lack of skills needed by employers.</p>
<p>There big disparity in access to opportunities in the inner cities as compared to rich affluent neighborhoods. There is proof that black people are being denied their right to vote. According to the Los Angeles times “Some States continued in 2017 to pass laws that make it harder, rather than easier, for people of color to vote”. This is being done by voter suppression and gerrymandering. Even the measures that have been put in place to fight this unequal distribution of opportunities don’t seem to work. Affirmative action is a sugarcoating the bitter truth. According to The Brookings institute "Black professionals make up a small fraction of the total black middle class. And their numbers would have grown without preferences, the historical record strongly suggests". Affirmative action doesn’t work contrary to the argument.
<p>There is no denying that the fight for civil rights for black people has a long way to go. The is a lot but needs to change. The question is; What needs to change? Human beings? Government policies? The African Americans attitudes? Racial bias training for school kids and law enforcement officers? Or is it a combination of all the above?
